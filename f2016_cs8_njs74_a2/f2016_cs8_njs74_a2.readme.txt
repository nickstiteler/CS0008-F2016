# Description: Assignment #2 in the fall semester of 2016
# Notes/Thought Process:

I need to create a file that indefinitely loops till the user has entered the desired number
of file names.

I then need to use a for loop that will go through and find the number of lines in each file and the distance
of the file

Next I need to find the total number of line and the total distance of all the files inputted

Finally I need to print in the form:

    File to be read: file_1.csv
    Partial Total # of lines  : x1
    Partial distance run      : y1

    File to be read: file_2.csv
    Partial Total # of lines  : x2
    Partial distance run      : y2

    File to be read: quit

    Totals
    Total # of lines          : x1 + x2
    Total distance run        : y1 + y2
