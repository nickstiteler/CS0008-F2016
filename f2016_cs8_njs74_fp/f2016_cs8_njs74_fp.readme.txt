A customer needs to process a number of text files (called data files) that contain names and distance
run by study participants. The format of those files is as follows:
Max,34.23
Barbara,23.00
Luka,12.87
…
In those files, each row is a comma separated list of 2 values: the first one is the name of the participant
and the second is the distance that the participant has run.
The names of the input files are stored one per line in an additional file, called the master input list.
This file has the following structure:
<data file 1>
<data file 2>
<data file 3>
…
Write a program that read the master input list file, retrieves the names of the data files and from each
one of the data files reads every line, extract name and distance. Once the program has all the data in
memory, it has to compute the following quantities and informations:
• number of files read in input
• total number of lines read
• total distance run (aka the sum of all the distances loaded from provided files)
• total distance run for each individual participant
• individual maximum distance run and by which participant
• individual minimum distance run and by which participant
• report if there are any participants that appears more than once, how many times and their
names
• total number of participants

CS 0008 – Fall 2016 Final Project Due: 2016/12/15
The program should provide output on the screen similar to the following:
Number of Input files read : xx
Total number of lines read : xx
total distance run : xxxx.xxxxx
max distance run : xxxx.xxxxx
by participant : participant name
min distance run : xxxx.xxxxx
by participant : participant name
Total number of participants : xx
Number of participants
with multiple records : xx
The program should also create an output file reporting name of the participant, how many times their
name appears in the input files and the total distance run. Each row should be as follows:
Max,3,124.23
Barbara,2,65.00
Luka,1,12.87
…
A zip file named f2016_cs8_fp.data.zip is provided with this assignment. It contains the following
additional files that are to be used to test the final project:
• f2016_cs8_fp.data.txt: master input list
• f2016_cs8_fp.data.1.csv: data file 1
• f2016_cs8_fp.data.2.csv: data file 2
• f2016_cs8_fp.data.3.csv: data file 3
The output file mentioned above, that has to be created by the student program, should be named:
• f2016_cs8_<username>_fp.data.output.csv

In this program, the student should make the best use of everything that has learn so far in this class, reuse
as much as he/she can from assignment #3, improve upon it and he/she has to use a class named
participants that has 2 properties:
• name: name of the participant. String.
• distance: accumulator for total distance run by the participant. Float.
• runs: accumulator for the total number of runs run by the participant.
and, at least, the following methods:
• addDistance(d)
add single distance to the distance accumulator and increments runs by 1.
Argument d is a single float.
• addDistances(ld)
add an array of distances to distance accumulator. Argument ld is a list of floats.
• getDistance()
get the current value of the distance accumulator.
• getName()
get the name of the participant of the current instance
• __init__ (n,d=0)
initializer method. set name and initial distance if provided. If initial distance is not specified, it
should be set to zero
• __str__()
stringify method. Returns a string with name, total distance run and how many distances the
object added, according to the following format:
Name : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Distance run : yyyy.yyyy. Runs : zzzz
where xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is a right align string of 20 characters for the name, yyyy.yyyy is the
total distance run with 9 digits, decimal point and 4 decimals, and zzzz is the number of runs
with 4 digits, no decimals.
