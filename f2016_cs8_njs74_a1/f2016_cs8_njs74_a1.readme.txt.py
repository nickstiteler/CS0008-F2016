# Description:
# The first assignment. Asking to create a program that satisfies the customers
# request, like calculating and converting the gas, consumption, distance, and
# gas consumption rating
# Example: Assignment 1
3
# Notes:
# First the units used are set using an input. Then initial variables are set for distance and gas.
# There are two main paths that are required to create this program. One if the
# input is in metric and another if it is in US Customary. In each path there are the conversions for either usc to
# metric or metric to usc. After that is the print statements which includes the formatting of the final print values.
